# Deep_machine_learning_challenge
To successfully complete this challenge, you need to follow the instructions and steps outlined in the document. Here's a summary of the tasks you need to complete:

Preprocess the Data:

Read the charity_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Identify the target variable(s) and feature(s) for your model.
Drop the EIN and NAME columns.
Determine the number of unique values for each column.
For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value and create a new value called "Other" for rare categorical variables.
Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.
Split the data into features array (X) and target array (y) and then split them into training and testing datasets.
Scale the training and testing features using StandardScaler.
Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model:

Create a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras, defining the number of input features and nodes for each layer.
Create hidden layers and an output layer with appropriate activation functions.
Compile and train the model, using a callback to save the model's weights every five epochs.
Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy.
Save the results to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5."
Optimize the Model:

Repeat the preprocessing steps in a new Jupyter Notebook.
Create a new neural network model, implementing at least three optimization methods to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
Save the optimized model results to an HDF5 file named "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimisation.h5."
Write a Report on the Neural Network Model:

Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders.
Explain the purpose of the analysis.
Address questions related to data preprocessing and model compilation, training, and evaluation.
Summarize the overall results of your model and include a recommendation for a different model that could potentially solve this classification problem.
